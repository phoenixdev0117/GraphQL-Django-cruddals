# ðŸ’¡ What can Graphene Django CRUDDALS do for you?

Graphene Django CRUDDALS is a tool that allows you to build a complete GraphQL API from a Django model in a matter of seconds.

1. Automatically generates a complete GraphQL schema from a Django model.
2. Automatically generates the necessary ObjectTypes, InputObjectTypes, Fields, InputFields, Arguments, Mutations, Queries, and resolvers to interact with a Django model.
3. Automatically generates 8 CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) + DALS (Deactivate, Activate, List, Search) operations for a Django model in seconds.
4. Generates each of the Create, Update, Delete, Deactivate, Activate, List, and Search operations, all to be performed massively.
5. Automatically handles required and non-required fields of Django models based on the blank and null attributes.
6. Automatically handles editable and non-editable fields of Django models based on the editable attribute.
7. Automatically generates documentation for the fields of Django models based on the help_text attribute.
8. Automatically generates default values for Django model fields based on the default attribute.
9. Automatically generates enums for Django model fields based on the choices attribute.
10. Handles one-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many relationships, both directly and inversely.
11. Handles nested model relationships for mutations, allowing nested mutations.
12. Handles nested model relationships for queries, allowing nested queries at any depth level, with all pagination, sorting, and advanced search features.
13. Handles pagination of query results, both at the top level and for nested levels.
14. Handles sorting of query results.
15. Handles advanced search to perform complex and nested queries with model fields, related fields, and logical operators AND, OR, NOT.
16. Handles (thanks to graphene-file-upload) File and ImageField types of Django.
17. Handles JSONField types of Django to deliver them as a JSON string or as a JSON object.
18. Has excellent data validation in mutations (thanks to DjangoForm), providing a friendly and comprehensive list of errors.
19. Exposes a function to use the ObjectTypes generated from the models.
20. Handles polymorphic relationships, both one-to-many and many-to-one.
21. Additionally, you can extend and/or customize each part of the GraphQL schema generated by Graphene Django CRUDDALS, such as ObjectTypes, InputObjectTypes, Fields, InputFields, Arguments, Mutations, Queries, and even resolvers.
22. Additionally, you can generate CRUD+DALS operations at the model, app, or project level. Therefore, it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 10 apps in your project, or if you have 1 or 100 models, Graphene Django CRUDDALS will generate all the operations for you for each of your models with just 3 lines of code. (This ultimately depends on the level at which you build your GraphQL API, whether it's at the model, app, or project level) and you can rest assured that regardless of the desired level, you can always customize and extend the generated GraphQL schema as granularly as you want and/or need.
23. Generates a folder with the necessary files for consuming the GraphQL API with any JavaScript client, following the best practices of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and saving hours of work, messy code, and errors. Don't think about how to consume your GraphQL API, Graphene Django CRUDDALS does it for you. (Just consume it)
24. Generates a file with the queries and mutations created so that you can test your GraphQL API with GraphiQL.
25. Generates a .gql and .json file with the entire GraphQL schema generated so that you can share it with your team or anyone interested, or you can also use it with other GraphQL tools for the frontend like those in the ecosystem https://the-guild.dev/#platform, Apollo, etc., or so you can migrate to another language or backend framework. The possibilities are endless.
